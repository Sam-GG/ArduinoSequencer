# ArduinoSequencer
8-note arduino nano v3 sequencer. Everything from controls to digital sound generation.

**Current scope:** 8 toggle-able buttons that correspond to a digital squarewave out, which is tuned by a universal potentiometer. Also tempo control.

**Stretch goals:** 
* Unison 
* A built-in ASDR generator for controlling an external analog filter
* Store and playback multiple sequences/bars, allowing more than 8 notes on repeat
