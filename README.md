# ArduinoSequencer
8-note arduino nano v3 sequencer. Everything from controls to digital sound generation.

**Current scope:** 8 toggle-able buttons that correspond to a digital squarewave out, which is tuned by a universal potentiometer. Also tempo control.

**Stretch goals:** Unison, and a built-in ASDR generator to control an exterior analog filter.
